Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Phosphor React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from phosphor-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.

All designs should be responsive. Implement the design exactly as shown in the attached image.

The page file should only import components; dummy data and page logic should be stored in separate files. Create a separate folder for each routed page, and place the Page and layout files inside it.

Do not build status bar. Use shadcn ScrollArea component.
